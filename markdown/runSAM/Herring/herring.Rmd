## **Norwegian Spring Spawning Herring** 
In this case study you learn to:

* run SAM for Norwegian Spring Spawning Herring.
* validate a SAM assessment.
* set TAC for herring.

In thic case study it is assumed that you have a good overview of how SAM works. If you want to learn more about the therory behind SAM and how it is implemented, see [https://github.com/skaug/tmb-case-studies/tree/master/SAM](https://github.com/skaug/tmb-case-studies/tree/master/SAM) for case studies which elaborate SAM. 


To run a SAM model can be divided into five standard steps:

1. Read data
2. Set up SAM data
3. Set up configurations
4. Define parameters
5. Fit SAM

In this case study we illustrates how to modify these parts to use settings from XSAM. We start with fitting a standard SAM with the herring data, and then extend the model to include XSAM options currently used in the herring assessment.

## Evaluate assessment
The assessment is based on a given set of configuration settings. We will now validate these settings and the model used. In this section we will look at the following three key features:

1. AIC
2. OSA residuals
3. Retrospective patterns

<details>  
  <summary>AIC</summary>
```{r}
  AIC(fitStandard, fitCurrent)
```
  <em>Note: The standard used settings give much lower AIC, meaning that the model fits data significantly better.</em>
</details>

<details>  
  <summary>OSA-residals</summary>
```r
  resStandard = residuals(fitStandard) 
  resCurrent = residuals(fitCurrent)  
  plot(resStandard)
  plot(resCurrent)
```
  <em>Note: It is less structure in the OSA residuals when using the standard settings, which indicates that the standard settings are more appropopriate.</em>

    ![](resCurrent.png)



</details>

<details>  
  <summary>Retrospective patterns</summary>
```r
  retroStandard = retro(fitStandard,year = 7) 
  retroCurrent = retro(fitCurrent,year = 7)
  plot(retroStandard)
  plot(retroCurrent)
```
  <em>Note: It is less retrospective patterns when using the standard settings, which indicates that the standard settings are more appropopriate.</em>

In the Norwegian Spring Spawning herring assessment it is used three survey indices in addition to the commercial catch data. We can investigate the effect of removing one or more of these surveys from the assessment model by using the `leaveout` function in SAM.

<details>  
  <summary>Leaveout</summary>
```r
  leavoutStandard= leaveout(fitStandard)
  plot(leavoutStandard)
```
  <em>Note: Survey `FeedingareasintheNorwegianSeainMay` seems to be the survey with most information.</em>

## Propose new settings


Propose new configuration settings for Norwegian Spring Spawning Herring. Key features to modify are:

1. Coupling of observation variances
2. Correlation structure of observations
3. Model for fishing mortality
4. Usage of external variances
5. Include or exclude process error
6. Recruitment


Propose several configuration settings, and argue which proposal is the best.

## TAC for 2020
The target level of exploration is calculated with the following formula:
\begin{align}
  F_{tr}=
  \begin{cases}
  0.05 ,& \text{if } \text{SSB} \leq B_{lim}  \\
  0.14- 0.09\frac{B_{pa} - \text{SSB}}{B_{pa}-\text{B}_{lim}} ,& \text{if } \text{B}_{lim} < \text{SSB} \leq B_{pa}  \\
  0.14 ,& \text{if } \text{B}_{pa} < \text{SSB}
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
where $\text{B}_{lim} = 2.5$ million tonnes. and $\text{B}_{pa} = 3.184$ million tonnes.


In 2019 it is estimated to be caught 773 750 tons of herring. 
<details>  
  <summary>Predict SSB January 1st. 2020</summary>
```r
  set.seed(12345)
  forecast(fitCurrent,catchval.exact = c(773.750,0))
```
We predict the SSB to be approximately 3.783 million tonnes in 1st january 2020. By using the target level of exploration formula above, we want to target the fishing mortalty to $F_{tr} =  0.14$ in 2020. 
</details>


<details>  
  <summary>Forecast catches in 2020 with $\bar F_w = F_{tr}$</summary>
```r
  set.seed(12345)
  forecast(fitCurrent,catchval.exact = c(773.750,NA,NA),fBarW = c(NA,0.14,0.14),nosim = 1000) 
```
Estimated catch in 2020 is 533 000 tonnes, which is the advised TAC. 

<em>Note: Currently we need to use a development version of SAM to forecast with weighted F which is used in the TAC calculation procedure for herring. The development version can be installed by typing
```r
  devtools::install_github("fishfollower/SAM/stockassessment",ref = "forecastWeightedF")
```
</em>

## Compare SAM assessment with XSAM assessment

The 2019 XSAM-assessment of  herring can be found in chapter 4 in the  [WGWIDE](http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Expert%20Group%20Report/Fisheries%20Resources%20Steering%20Group/2019/WGWIDE/01%20WGWIDE%20Report%202019.pdf) report. Compare a SAM assessment with XSAM-options with the the assessment given in the WGWIDE report. Key features to compare are

1.  Likelihood
2.  Estimated parameters
3.  SSB
4.  F-bar
5.  Recruitment
6.  Retrospective plots
7.  TAC
